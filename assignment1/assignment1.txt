In this assignment we will come up with initial design for a software application that you will build in this semester. 
We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only looking at some initial design ideas and high level architecture.

Description: 
A partner of your company has requested to build a software application that will predict the
fuel rate based on the following criteria:
- Client Location
- Competitors rate
- Client rate history
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)
- Seasonal rate fluctuation (%)

Software must include following components:
- Login (Allow Cleint to register if not a client yet)
- Cleint Registration (Initially only username and Password)
- Client Profile Management (After client registers they should login first to complete profile)
- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module predicts the rate)
- Fuel Quote History

Answer these questions:

1.	Discuss your initial thoughts on how you will design this program? (20)

2.	Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (20)

3.	Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (60)


NOTE: Include a separate file (a PDF, tiff, word document, etc.) which shows a UML diagram of your design.

Here are some architecture examples:
